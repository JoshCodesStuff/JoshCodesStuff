# Hi, I'm Josh

I am a part time Uni student, studying Computer Science. I'm in the final year of my degree.
I like video game programming however I work on many different kinds of projects. I'm currently working on a machine learning approach to analysing and categorising forum data, which will allow students and researchers to find trends in large data sets, but could also be applied to other text formats.

## I've got a lot or Repos
I recommend these repos:
- [Metroidvania Game Config](https://github.com/JoshCodesStuff/MetrovaniaTutorialScripts)
- [Python3 HTTP Proxy](https://github.com/JoshCodesStuff/python-proxy)
- [Emacs Config](https://gist.github.com/JoshCodesStuff/304ecd801c78eb68cbbd0fe448d79502)
- [BeautifulSoup web scraper](https://github.com/CompanyFirmInc/_ruski)

I am beginning to write articles on Medium about the different things I am doing in my University degree. If you're interested you may want to check it out [here](https://joshcodesstuff.medium.com/).
