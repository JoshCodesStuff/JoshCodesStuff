# Hi, I'm Josh

### About Me
I'm 22, I am a part time Uni student studying Computer Science. I'm in the final year of my degree.
I like video game programming however I work on many different kinds of projects. I'm currently working on a machine learning approach to analysing large samples of data, and organising it for researchers to use.
