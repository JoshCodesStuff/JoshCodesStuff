# Hi, I'm Josh

## About Me
I am a part time Uni student, studying Computer Science. I'm in the final year of my degree.
I like video game programming however I work on many different kinds of projects. I'm currently working on a machine learning approach to analysing large samples of data, and organising it which will allow researchers to use it in varying applications.

## I've got a lot or Repos
I recommend these repos:
- [Metroidvania Game Config](https://github.com/JoshCodesStuff/MetrovaniaTutorialScripts)
- [Python3 HTTP Proxy](https://github.com/JoshCodesStuff/python-proxy)
- Emacs Config - coming soon
- PRAW Reddit data scraper - coming soon

I am beginning to write articles on Medium about the different things I am doing in my University degree. If you're interested you may want to check it out [here](https://joshcodesstuff.medium.com/).
