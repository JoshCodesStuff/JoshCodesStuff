# Hi, I'm Josh

I work in tech and I like to make things. I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science from The University of Adelaide in November of 2023. I am interested in the field of Cyber Security and Artificial Intelligence. I was taught C/C++ and Python in Uni, with a focus on data structures, memory analysis and machine learning algorithms. I also learned web development skills (HTML, CSS, VueJS, AJAX, Node) and picked up a little client and serverside Javascript. In my Computer Systems course I built part of a Java-esque programming language and in my CNA course I built a very basic web server in C and a Python proxy server to handle HTTP/1.1 requests. 

While I was in High School I started making platformer games in the Unity game engine. I wrote the game mechanics in C#, which was my first programming language. During my university degree, I started making a metroidvania platformer on YouTube, which was somewhat popular but due to the time and effort it took to produce, I decided to stop making content. I don't upload to YouTube as I am currently trying to have something called a *work life balance*, but I am still making my metroidvania in my spare time. I have ported the game to the Godot engine and I am writing it in GDScript which is more similar to Python (my language of choice). I might upload content in the future but for now, I'd rather get my game to a playable state.

## Look at all those repos

I recommend these repositories:

### [Metroidvania Game Config](https://github.com/JoshCodesStuff/MetrovaniaTutorialScripts)

Basically the starting point for a game built in C#. I might archive this eventually or make the Godot version on top of what I had.

### [Python3 HTTP Proxy](https://github.com/JoshCodesStuff/python-proxy)

This is a fully working proxy that can be used with firefox to download and analyse data from a webserver. I even wrote a client which you can configure to run commands through the proxy.

### [Emacs Config](https://gist.github.com/JoshCodesStuff/304ecd801c78eb68cbbd0fe448d79502)

I tried to make an Emacs config before switching to Doom Emacs. It technically works but it's more just a flex that I know Emacs (I know Vim too)

### [BeautifulSoup web scraper](https://github.com/CompanyFirmInc/_ruski)

This is a web scraping tool that was purpose built to grab Kremlin public posts. It's useful if you want to learn how to program a BeautifulSoup4 web scraper but I wouldn't try it on other websites.
