# Hi, I'm Josh

I work in tech and I like to make things. I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science from The University of Adelaide in November of 2023. I am most interested in the field of Cyber Security and Data Analysis. I was taught C/C++ and Python in Uni, with a focus on data structures, memory analysis and machine learning algorithms.

## Look at all those repos

I recommend these repositories:

### [Metroidvania Game Config](https://github.com/JoshCodesStuff/MetrovaniaTutorialScripts)

Basically the starting point for a game built in C#. I might archive this eventually or make the Godot version on top of what I had.

### [Python3 HTTP Proxy](https://github.com/JoshCodesStuff/python-proxy)

This is a fully working proxy that can be used with firefox to download and analyse data from a webserver. I even wrote a client which you can configure to run commands through the proxy.

### [Emacs Config](https://gist.github.com/JoshCodesStuff/304ecd801c78eb68cbbd0fe448d79502)

I tried to make an Emacs config before switching to Doom Emacs. It technically works but it's more just a flex that I know Emacs (I know Vim too)

### [BeautifulSoup web scraper](https://github.com/CompanyFirmInc/_ruski)

This is a web scraping tool that was purpose built to grab Kremlin public posts. It's useful if you want to learn how to program a BeautifulSoup4 web scraper but I wouldn't try it on other websites.
